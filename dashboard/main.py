        - Spring: The average number of bike rentals is 2,604.13. This is the lowest among all seasons, possibly due to the transition from colder to warmer weather.
        - Summer: The average number of bike rentals increases significantly to 4,992.33, likely due to warmer and more favorable weather for outdoor activities like biking.

        - Winter: The average number of bike rentals decreases to 4,728.16, likely due to colder weather.

        - The year starts with a moderate number of rentals in January (2,176.34), which increases slightly in February (2,655.3).
        - In March, there’s a significant spike to 3,692.26 rentals. This could be due to warmer weather or other seasonal factors that make biking more popular.
        - From April to September, the numbers remain relatively high, ranging from 4,484.9 (April) to 5,766.52 (September). This period likely represents the peak biking season.
        - Starting in October, there’s a noticeable decrease in bike rentals, with numbers dropping to 3,403.81 by December. This could be due to colder weather or other factors that make biking less popular.

        This pattern suggests a strong seasonal trend in bike rentals, with demand peaking in the warmer months and decreasing in the colder months. It also shows that within each season, certain months (like March in Spring, September in Fall) might have higher bike rentals due to specific weather conditions or events.

        The humidity data you provided can be particularly insightful for your bike rental data analysis. Here's a more contextual explanation:

        - Maximum Humidity: The peak recorded relative humidity was {(main_df['hum'].max() * 100):.2f}%. Such high humidity levels could potentially deter bike rentals due to the discomfort associated with heavy moisture in the air, often leading to heavy rainfall or dense fog conditions.

        - Mean Humidity: The average relative humidity was {(main_df['hum'].mean() * 100):.2f}%. This moderate level of humidity suggests a balanced weather condition which might not significantly impact the decision to rent bikes.

        - Minimum Humidity: The lowest recorded relative humidity was {(main_df['hum'].min() * 100):.2f}%, indicating extremely dry conditions. While low humidity might make the weather seem more pleasant for outdoor activities like biking, extremely dry conditions can also cause discomfort and could potentially impact bike rental numbers.

        Understanding these humidity levels can help predict bike rental patterns and make informed decisions about resource allocation and marketing strategies. For instance, additional promotions could be planned for times when the weather is expected to have moderate humidity, which might boost rentals.

            - Increase Availability During Peak Seasons:
            
                The data shows that bike rentals peak during the summer and fall seasons. Therefore, it would be beneficial to increase bike availability during these months to meet the high demand.
            
            - Maintenance and Repair During Off-Peak Seasons:
                
                The winter and spring seasons show a lower demand for bike rentals. This would be a good time to schedule regular maintenance and repairs to ensure that the bikes are in optimal condition for the peak season.

            - Promotional Activities:
                
                To encourage bike rentals during off-peak seasons or months with lower demand, promotional activities such as discounts or loyalty programs could be introduced.

            - Alternative Usage:
                
                During colder months when demand is low, consider alternative uses for the bikes. For example, they could be rented out for longer periods or used in partnership with local tour operators for guided tours.

            - Dynamic Pricing:
                
                Implement a dynamic pricing model where prices are lower during off-peak seasons to encourage usage, and higher during peak seasons when demand is high.

            - Weather-Proof Bikes:
                
                Consider investing in weather-proof bikes or providing additional equipment like rain covers or warmer gear during colder months to attract customers.

            Yes, it is possible to predict bike rental demand based on weather conditions using machine learning models. Weather conditions such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather situation (clear, cloudy, rainy, etc.) can significantly influence the demand for bike rentals.

            Based on the graph you provided, we can see clear trends in bike rentals across different weather situations. For instance, Weather Situation 1 (Clear, Few clouds, Partly cloudy) has the highest number of rentals, followed by Weather Situation 2 (Mist + Cloudy, Mist + Broken clouds, Mist + Few clouds), and then Weather Situation 3 (Light Snow, Light Rain + Thunderstorm + Scattered clouds). This suggests that clear or partly cloudy weather is most favorable for bike rentals, while inclement weather like rain or snow reduces the demand.

            These trends can be used to train a machine learning model to predict bike rental demand based on weather conditions. The model could take in weather data as input and output the predicted number of bike rentals. This could be particularly useful for planning and resource allocation in bike rental services.
